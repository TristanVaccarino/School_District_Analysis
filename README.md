# School_District_Analysis


## Overview

  The purpose of this analysis is to gauge how the schools in the district are doing using their math and reading scores. We're going to look at budget and student size for the individual schools to see if there are any correlations to student scores. Thomas High School's Ninth graders reported having acedemic dishonesty so in return we null their scores and we'll look at the implications of that on our data
  
  
## Results of analysis
  - The district summary shown below shows a slight a majority of students that are passing their classes orverall.

   - The replacment of the 9th grades at Thomas High School severly dropped the overall passing rate of that school. By essentially cutting out a quarter of their student population we're left with 65% of that school passing, which is still a 14% difference between Thomas High School and overall grades of all district schools.
    
   - Without the 9th grader grades' being accounted for, Thomas High School ranks lower than all other charter schools in 'Percent Passing Math', and 'Percent Passing Reading'. This also made it one of the only Charter Schools, and smaller sized school to have a passing rate lower than 89%
    
## Summary

In conclusion, the changes made to the 9th graders of Thomas High School negatively affected their performance compared to other Charter Schools and schools of their own size. This also made it one of the worst rated charter schools in 'Percent Passing Math", and 'Percent Passing Reading.'
